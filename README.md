## Description
This is a code for a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).
It prompts user to input details about their project, and then dynamically generates a professional README file that features:
* Project title
* Project description
* License badge and link
* A hyperlinked table of contents
* Usage and installation instructions
* Testing and contributing instructions
* Information and contact details of the developer

It can be run on any machine that has git/bash installed and requires minimal coding skills to operate.
